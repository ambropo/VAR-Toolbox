function [m, f]  = double(o) % --*-- Unitary tests --*--

% Returns a vector of doubles with the fractional part corresponding
% to the subperiod. Used for plots and to store dates in a matrix.
%
% INPUTS
% - o [dates]
%
% OUTPUTS
% - m [double] o.ndat*1 vector of doubles.
% - f [integer] scalar, the frequency (1, 2, 4, or 12).
%
% REMARKS
%  Obviously the frequency is lost during the conversion.
