function q = backcast(o, p, diff)  % --*-- Unitary tests --*--

% Chains two dseries objects.
%
% INPUTS
% - o     [dseries]
% - p     [dseries]
%
% OUTPUTS
% - q     [dseries]
%
% REMARKS
% The two dseries objects must have common frequency and the same number of variables. Also the
% two samples must overlap.
